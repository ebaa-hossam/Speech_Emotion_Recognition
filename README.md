# Speech_Emotion_Recognition
Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a powerful application of deep learning in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and signal processing. This project leverages the TensorFlow framework to build a robust SER model that can automatically detect and classify emotions from spoken language.

#Key Features
*Deep Learning Model: Our SER model is based on deep neural networks and is trained on a diverse dataset of emotional speech samples.
*Multiple Emotion Classes: The model can recognize a range of emotions, including happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and more.
*Visualization: Visualize the recognition results and emotions using user-friendly dashboards and plots.
